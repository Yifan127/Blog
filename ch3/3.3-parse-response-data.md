### Parse Response Data

In the response data of Open Weather Map API, the time is displayed in UNIX timestamp, like this: **"dt":1485913525,"**

Also, the wind degree need to be converted to readable compass direction, for example: **"wind":{"deg":2.50012}** to **North**

* **What's UNIX time stamp**

The unix time stamp is a way to track time as a running total of seconds. This count starts at the **Unix Epoch on January 1st, 1970 at UTC**. Therefore, **the unix time stamp is merely the number of seconds between a particular date and the Unix Epoch**.  It should be point out that **this point in time technically does not change no matter where you are located on the globle**. This is very useful to computer systems for tracking and sorting dated information in **dynamic and distributed applications** both online and client side.

* **What happens on January 19, 2038?**

On this date the Unix Time Stamp will cease to work due to a **32-bit overflow**. Before this moment millions of applications will need to either adopt a new convention for time stamps or be migrated to **64-bit systems** which will buy the time stamp a "bit" more time.

* **Convert UNIX timestamp to readable format string**
    
    1. Import **datetime**.
    2. Use **datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp, tz=None)** to convert timestamp to datetime object. If optional argument **tz is None or not specified**, the timestamp is converted to the platform’s local date and time, and the returned datetime object is **naive**.
    ```python
    >>> from datetime import datetime
    
    >>> dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1485913525)
    >>> print(dt)
    2017-02-01 14:45:25
    ```
    3. Python’s datetime.datetime objects have a **tzinfo attribute** that can be used to store time zone information, represented as an instance of a subclass of datetime.tzinfo. **When this attribute is set and describes an offset, a datetime object is aware. Otherwise, it’s naive.**
    
    In this case, I need an aware object, so the user could know the timezone info. 

    4. **from dateutil import tz**, use **tz.tzlocal()** to get local timezone
    ```python
    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> from dateutil import tz

    >>> dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1485913525, tz.tzlocal())
    >>> print(dt)
    2017-02-01 14:45:25+13:00
    ```
    5. Use **datetime.strftime(format)**  to convert the datetime object to a readable string in a particular format.
    ```python
    from datetime import datetime
    from dateutil import tz
    
    dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1485913525, tz.tzlocal())
    print(dt, type(dt))
    
    fmt = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z'
    dt_string = datetime.strftime(fmt)
    print(dt_string, type(dt_string))
    ```
    
    Output is:
    ```
    2017-02-01 14:45:25+13:00 <class 'datetime.datetime'>
    2017-02-01 14:45:25 +1300 <class 'str'>
    ```

* **Convert wind degree to readable compass direction**
![](/assets/ch3/wind_degree.PNG)

```python
def deg_to_direction(deg):
'''convert wind degree to compass direction'''
direction = ['N', 'NNE', 'NE', 'ENE',
             'E', 'ESE', 'SE', 'SSE',
             'S', 'SSW', 'SW', 'WSW',
             'W', 'WNW', 'NW', 'NNW']
value = int((deg / 22.5) + 0.5)
return direction[value % 16]
```
